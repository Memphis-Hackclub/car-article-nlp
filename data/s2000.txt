The Honda S2000 is an open top sports car that was manufactured by Japanese automobile manufacturer Honda, from 1999 to 2009. First shown as a concept car at the Tokyo Motor Show in 1995, the production version was launched on April 15, 1999 to celebrate the company's 50th anniversary. The S2000 is named for its engine displacement of twoÂ liters, carrying on in the tradition of the S500, S600, and S800 roadsters of the 1960s.

Several revisions were made throughout the car's production life, including changes to the engine, gearbox, suspension, interior and exterior. Officially two variants exist: the initial launch model was given the chassis code AP1; though cosmetically similar, the facelifted version, known as the AP2 in North America and Japan, incorporated significant changes to the drivetrain and suspension. Production of the S2000 ceased on August 19th 2009.
The Honda S2000 was notable for its exceptional specific power output of about 124 hp per litre, or about two horsepower per cubic inch, the highest of any mass production, naturally aspirated engined car.[2]
